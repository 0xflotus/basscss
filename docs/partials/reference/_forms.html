<h1 class="mb0">Forms</h1>
<p>
  Forms use default base styles for their structural appearance
  and thematic styles for colors and borders.
  This creates a rhythmic consitency among all forms while allowing thematic
  differences where needed.
  Form elements do not rely on nested styles or markup structure,
  so utility styles can be used for contextual adjustments.

<h2>Inline Forms</h2>
<p>
  By default, form elements are display inline.
  Use the default <code>.input</code> theme or create custom themes to control the look.

<h2>Stacked Forms</h2>
<p>
  Use <code>.block</code> and other utilities to stack form elements.
  This allows for a lot of flexibility with form layouts.
