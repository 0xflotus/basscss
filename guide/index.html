  <section id="markup" class="py2">
    <h1>Document structure</h1>
    <p class="p">HTML is a semantically structured markup language. When building anything on the web, start with clean structured markup that accurately reflects your information hierarchy. When hierarchy changes, be sure to update the markup before making any stylistic changes. The most important parts of web design involve no CSS at all.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="multi-class-pattern" class="py2">
    <h1>Multiclass CSS pattern</h1>
    <p class="p">BASSCSS is based on Object Oriented CSS (OOCSS) principles. OOCSS has many benefits, including code readability, reusable styles, smaller CSS files, more performant selectors, more flexible markup structure, and code scalability. BASSCSS is meant to be a very simple and intuitive take on this approach, well suited to designing in the browser, rapid prototyping, or serving as the basis for a larger project.</p>
    <p class="p">One of the defining features of OOCSS is the multiclass pattern. This is the practice of using multiple classes on a single HTML element. This can seem strange at first, but once you get the hang of things, it can make designing and building websites much faster and easier. It also has some significant front-end performance benefits.</p>
    <h2>Example</h2>
    <div class="p1 mb2 bg-light-gray rounded">
{% highlight html %}
<div class="h3 p1 mb2 bg-light-gray rounded">
  A box with font-size .h3, padding, margin-bottom, a light gray background and rounded corners
</div>
{% endhighlight %}
    </div>
    <h2>Order</h2>
    <p class="p">While the order of classes doesn't matter to the browser, maintaining a consistent order will drastically improve code readability. I recommend the following order:</p>
    <ol class="p">
      <li>Typography - this sets the visual hieararchy and is one of the most important parts of web design</li>
      <li>Positioning - this can severly change document flow</li>
      <li>Layout - this can affect other elements and document flow</li>
      <li>Theme - this has little or no effect on layout and is likely to change frequently when designing</li>
      <li>State - this is dynamic and often unnecessary</li>
    </ol>
  </section>

  <section id="typography" class="py2">
    <h1>Writing and Typography</h1>
    <p class="p">Good writing and typography are key to successful web design. They are the basis of user flows and information hierarchy. Ensure the links, form labels, helper text, buttons, and other microcopy receive as much attention as body copy, and remember the two serve very different purposes. Typography should also serve as the basis for gestalt within the design.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="block-level-inline" class="py2">
    <h1>Block-level and Inline Elements</h1>
    <p class="p">There are two basic types of elements in HTML. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTML/Block-level_elements">Block-level elements</a> are larger container elements that begin on a new line and take up the entire width of their parent container by default. Block-level elements can also have set widths and heights. They may contain other block-level elements and inline elements.</p>
    <p class="p"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTML/Inline_elements">Inline elements</a> do not begin a new line and contain content and other inline elements. Inline elements are only as large as the content they contain.</p>
    <p class="p">In HTML5, things get a little more complicated, but the basics still apply: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Content_categories">HTML5 Content Categories</a>.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="display" class="py2">
    <h1>Display Property</h1>
    <p class="p">BASSCSS's display utilities override the default behaviors of block-level and inline elements. To make a block-level element inline, use the <code>.inline</code> class. To make inline elements block-level, use <code>.block</code>.</p>
    <p class="p">Inline-block is a mix of these two properties.
      Inline-block elements have a block element box, with optional width and height, but flow with surrounding content like an inline element.
      <del>Inline-block elements may have a width and height, but only take up the width of their contents and behave similarly to inline elements.</del>
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="box-model" class="py2">
    <h1>Box Model</h1>
    <p class="p">The box-model is the basis of all HTML layout. Understanding how it works is crucial to designing for the web. Block-level elements naturally fill the width of their parents. Margins add space around the element. Borders add space around the element, but within the margins. Padding adds space within the element.</p>
    <p class="p">If an element has a declared width, padding and borders will be added to the overall width. It's often easier to add padding and borders to child elements rather than directly to elements with set widths. For example, when using a grid system.</p>
    <div class="center p1 bg-light-gray">
      <p class="mb0">Margin</p>
      <div class="m1 py1 px2 bg-mid-gray border border-dark">
        <p class="">Padding</p>
        <div class="p2 white bg-dark">Content</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section id="floats" class="py2">
    <h1>Floats</h1>
    <p class="p">Floats are for wrapping text around images, but are also used for breaking elements out of the normal document flow. When you float an element left or right, the text will flow beside and around the element.</p>
    <div class="p1 mb1 mid-gray bg-light-gray rounded">
      <div class="right p1 m1 white bg-blue">.right</div>
      <p>Bacon ipsum dolor sit amet chuck prosciutto landjaeger ham hock filet mignon shoulder hamburger pig venison. Ham bacon corned beef, sausage kielbasa flank tongue pig drumstick capicola swine short loin ham hock kevin. Bacon t-bone hamburger turkey capicola rump short loin. Drumstick pork fatback pork chop doner pork belly prosciutto pastrami sausage. Ground round prosciutto shank pastrami corned beef venison tail. Turkey short loin tenderloin jerky porchetta pork loin.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="p1 mb2 bg-light-gray rounded">
{% highlight html %}
<div class="right">Floated right</div>
<p>Just a normal paragraph</p>
{% endhighlight %}
    </div>
    <p class="p">If an element contains only floated children, such as in a grid system, its height will collapse. Clearfixes are used to ensure the parent element maintains the height of its content. This container element is using the <code>.clearfix</code> class.</p>
    <div class="clearfix mb1 mid-gray bg-light-gray">
      <div class="left p2 white bg-blue">.left</div>
      <div class="left p2 white bg-blue">.left</div>
      <div class="right p2 white bg-blue">.right</div>
    </div>
    <div class="p1 mb2 bg-light-gray rounded">
{% highlight html %}
<div class="clearfix">
  <div class="left">Floated left</div>
  <div class="left">Floated left</div>
  <div class="right">Floated right</div>
</div>
{% endhighlight %}
    </div>
    <p class="p">Overflow hidden crops overflowing content, but can also be used as a clearfix because it creates what's called a new <i>block formatting context</i>.</p>
    <div class="oh mb1 mid-gray bg-light-gray">
      <div class="left p2 white bg-blue">.left</div>
      <div class="left p2 white bg-blue">
        .left
        <div class="p1 bg-mid-gray" style="width:64rem">wider than parent element</div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="p1 mb2 bg-light-gray rounded">
{% highlight html %}
<div class="oh">
  <div class="left">Floated left</div>
  <div class="left">
    Floated left
    <div style="width:64rem">wider than parent element</div>
  </div>
</div>
{% endhighlight %}
    </div>
    <p class="p">Using the overflow hidden property and its new block formatting context, sibling elements with overflow hidden will create a flexible column layout. This is the basis of the <a href="#">Media Object.</a></p>
    <div class="mb1 mid-gray bg-light-gray rounded">
      <div class="left p1 mr1 white bg-blue">.left</div>
      <div class="oh">
        <code class="h3">.oh (overflow hidden)</code>
        <p>Bacon ipsum dolor sit amet chuck prosciutto landjaeger ham hock filet mignon shoulder hamburger pig venison. Ham bacon corned beef, sausage kielbasa flank tongue pig drumstick capicola swine short loin ham hock kevin. Bacon t-bone hamburger turkey capicola rump short loin. Drumstick pork fatback pork chop doner pork belly prosciutto pastrami sausage. Ground round prosciutto shank pastrami corned beef venison tail.

<div class="oh">Container with overflow hidden</div>
{% endhighlight %}
    </div>
  </section>

  <section id="widths" class="py1">
    <h1>Widths</h1>
    <p class="p">The default document flow in HTML is fluid. This means that creating fluid and responsive layouts should be very easy to achieve. Avoid using fixed widths at all in your layout. Instead rely heavily on the normal document flow.</p>
    <p class="p">For elements with inherit widths, such as images, consider using a max-width of 100% to ensure it never overflows its container. Use the <code>.fit</code> class to do this.</p>
    <div class="p1 mb2 bg-light-gray rounded">
{% highlight html %}
<img src="cat.gif" alt="Cat" class="fit" />
{% endhighlight %}
    </div>
    <p class="p">If you do need to use widths, use percentages. Most grid systems these days use this approach, along with media queries to prevent the rigid layouts from the past. When using percentage-based widths, remember that the percentage is based on width of the parent, so nesting elements with percentage-based widths will get incrementally smaller as you nest.</p>
    <div class="clearfix mb1 bg-light-gray">
      <div class="left half-width py1">.left.half-width</div>
      <div class="left half-width clearfix">
        <div class="left half-width py1 bg-mid-gray">Nested .left.half-width</div>
        <div class="left half-width py1">Nested .left.half-width</div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="p1 mb2 bg-light-gray rounded">
{% highlight html %}
<div class="clearfix">
  <div class="left half-width">Half width</div>
  <div class="left half-width clearfix">
    <div class="left half-width">Half width within half width</div>
    <div class="left half-width">Half width within half width</div>
  </div>
</div>
{% endhighlight %}
    </div>
  </section>

  <section id="media-queries" class="py1">
    <h1>Media Queries and Mobile-First Approach</h1>
    <p class="p">When building responsive websites, best practices suggest using a mobile-first approach. First consider content and user flows, then create layouts that work well at small screen sizes and touch devices. Once that's in a good place use styling to enhance the experience on larger devices. Designing for tap targets first usually translates well to use with pointing devices.</p>
    <p class="p">BASSCSS includes several state utilities for showing and hiding content on mobile devices. Use these with care. Mobile users still want the same content across devices and often switch devices mid-task. Creating a cohesive experience is key to a good experience with your product.</p>
